Paul Thomas Gilbert (1876–1953) was one of the young Americans who went to the Philippines as a teacher shortly after the American take-over of the islands. In this book he describes his travels and adventures. After returning home, he continued as a reporter, and became the author of the popular Betram children’s stories. An interesting page on this author by his granddaughter can be found on www.bertramstories.com.
